**Research Goals:** I'm passionate about conducting research after my undergraduate study, especially about applying machine learning to impactful problems (e.g., medicine, language processing, communication system, and robotics). I am currently learning and applying some machine learning models for the vision of our [drone](https://mcgillrobotics.com/drone) designed at McGill Robotics, which I hope and believe is a small step to start with. I'm also interested in responsible and ethical issues in the research and application of AI.

#### Current Study
